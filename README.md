# multi-cursor-emacs-mark README

This is an extension written to mimic emacs marking behavior with minimal changes to vscode, but follows a slightly different schema than emacs keybindings. 

It is **using default cursor movement commands** in order to **support** what vscode chooses to support, which means it supports **multi-cursors**! 

## Functionality

Gives access to new markable commands and additional miscellaneous commands that can be used however you would like. I.e. replacement function for cut which also cancels mark when you cut text. It has incomplete support right now, but more can be added in the future. You can also use an extension, like [Macros](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=geddski.macros), to add support for things that are not supported yet. You can also add feature requests on
